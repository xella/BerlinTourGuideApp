        The King of Prussia and the Emperor of Germany lived in Berlin.
        The government of Germany was in Berlin for many years.
        Bombs destroyed many buildings in the city in World War Two.
        The city was split into West Berlin and East Berlin after World War Two.
        After the Berlin Wall was built in 1961 very few people were allowed to cross from East Berlin into West Berlin.
        The wall divided the city until 1989 when the East German government decided to allow anyone to cross,
        and people decided to destroy the wall.

    <string name="siegessauele_d">
        The Victory Column (German: Siegessäule) is a monument in Berlin, Germany. Designed by Heinrich Strack, after 1864 to commemorate the Prussian victory in the Danish-Prussian War,

        giving the statue a new purpose. Different from the original plans, these later victories in the socalled unification wars inspired the addition of the bronze sculpture of Victoria, 8.3 metres (27 ft) high and weighing 35 tonnes,
        designed by Fridrich Drake. Berliners have given the statue the nickname Goldelse, meaning something like "Golden Lizzy".

        The construction of this project, launched in 1906, follows a pattern of clear separation between residential areas, crafts, trade and culture, which distinguishes it from the courtyards of the 19th century.

        The people of Berlin are delighted with their new, yet old-established recreation area.
        The former Tempelhof airport is now a public park – and not for the first time in its history.
        Originally the Tempelhofer Feld was a parade ground.
        At the weekends and on public holidays, as soon as the military cleared the site, the locals would swarm in their thousands to Tempelhof to enjoy their leisure time.
        Whole families would come with their baskets full of food, deckchairs and sunshades to have picnics there.
        At the beginning of the 1920s, Tempelhof airport was built on the site.
        After the airport closed in 2008, the city of Berlin reclaimed the 386-hectare open space and one of the world\'s largest buildings in a central location for public use.
        Today, the area has a six-kilometre cycling, skating and jogging trail, a 2.5-hectare BBQ area, a dog-walking field covering around four hectares and an enormous picnic area for all visitors.

    <string name="park_am_gleisdreieck_d">
        The Park am Gleisdreieck is located on a former railway area around the traffic junction. Now it\'s one of Berlin\'s most popular parks.
        Berlin has long since been able to consider itself a metropolis with green fingers.
        There are many small and large recreation and leisure areas, especially in the inner-city districts.
        And in the future it is also intended to adhere to a healthy mixture of redevelopment and open spaces. The latest example of this urban planning concept is the recently created Park am Gleisdreieck (Gleisdreieck Park) in Kreuzberg. The railway area around the traffic junction at Gleisdreieck became a wasteland at the end of the Second World War, and developed a rich diversity of vegetation almost unnoticed. A citizens’ group was formed with the aim of ensuring a permanent existence for this unhoped-for refuge reclaimed by flora and fauna surrounded by dense redevelopment, and in the end they were successful. Many proposals and criticisms by residents were integrated into the planning process, which was notable for the strong public involvement. After its completion in 2013, the Park am Gleisdreieck connects to the green areas of the government quarter and Potsdamer Platz, and extend them in a southerly direction to the nature park at Schöneberger Südgelände. The eastern part of this park was opened in September 2011 and with its 17 hectares (42 acres) represents the larger part of the total area of 26 hectares (64 acres) that will be created between Tempelhofer Ufer and Yorckstraße. An ICE railway line cuts through this area in a north-south direction separating the two elements of the park from each other.
