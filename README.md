# BerlinTourGuideApp

For this project, I had to create a tour guide app which presents relevant information to a user who's visiting my city. 

The app list top attractions, museums, restaurants and public places.

User can navigate between lists using a Navigation Drawer.

App uses a custom adapter to populate the layout with views based on instances of the custom class.
